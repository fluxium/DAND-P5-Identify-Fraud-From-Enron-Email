1. Summarize for us the goal of this project and how machine learning is useful in trying to accomplish it. As part of your answer, give some background on the dataset and how it can be used to answer the project question. Were there any outliers in the data when you got it, and how did you handle those?  [relevant rubric items: �data exploration�, �outlier investigation�]

As I was working on this project, I placed myself in the shoes of an analyst at the FBI during the Enron investigation. My goal was to make sure that no individuals potentially involved in the fraud were overlooked. Starting with the current known persons of interest, could we create a model that would uncover an unseen pattern in their communication or financial behavior that would expose other potential persons of interest? The dataset that I had at my disposal contained a summary of email activity for several individuals as well as features breaking down their compensation structure. The dataset also contained a flag that identified our currently known persons of interest. The dataset was in fairly good shape to begin with. Several of the attributes in the dataset were sparsely populated and contained NaN values that had to be handled before working with them. The dataset also had a TOTAL key that was removed as an outlier since it represented the sum for each feature in the dataset.

2. What features did you end up using in your POI identifier, and what selection process did you use to pick them? Did you have to do any scaling? Why or why not? As part of the assignment, you should attempt to engineer your own feature that does not come ready-made in the dataset -- explain what feature you tried to make, and the rationale behind it. (You do not necessarily have to use it in the final analysis, only engineer and test it.) In your feature selection step, if you used an algorithm like a decision tree, please also give the feature importance of the features that you use, and if you used an automated feature selection function like SelectKBest, please report the feature scores and reasons for your choice of parameter values.  [relevant rubric items: �create new features�, �intelligently select features�, �properly scale features�]

Initially, to select features I decided to break the dataset in to two. One set containing only the persons of interest and the other containing only non-persons of interest. The means of each feature were compared between these groups using a t-test. The feature with the smallest p-value was added to the input features (exercised_stock_options) and a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier was trained and scored. The plan was to continue adding features to achieve the target precision and recall, however this single feature resulted in a trained model with the target performance.



3. What algorithm did you end up using? What other one(s) did you try? How did model performance differ between algorithms?  [relevant rubric item: �pick an algorithm�]

Since finding features and algorithm that met the target performance was trivial, I decided to experiment with an AutoML approach using the TPOT library for Python by Randal Olson (https://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/installing/). This approach uses genetic programming to discover optimized pipelines. The output of TPOT is a scikit-learn pipeline. Since this approach generated many different trained models to discover the best combination of operations, discovery take substantial compute time. I found that for our dataset the returns on performance diminished after letting TPOT run for more than 4 hours.

4. What does it mean to tune the parameters of an algorithm, and what can happen if you don't do this well?  How did you tune the parameters of your particular algorithm? What parameters did you tune? (Some algorithms do not have parameters that you need to tune -- if this is the case for the one you picked, identify and briefly explain how you would have done it for the model that was not your final choice or a different model that does utilize parameter tuning, e.g. a decision tree classifier).  [relevant rubric items: �discuss parameter tuning�, �tune the algorithm�]

5. What is validation, and what's a classic mistake you can make if you do it wrong? How did you validate your analysis?  [relevant rubric items: �discuss validation�, �validation strategy�]

6. Give at least 2 evaluation metrics and your average performance for each of them.  Explain an interpretation of your metrics that says something human-understandable about your algorithms performance. [relevant rubric item: �usage of evaluation metrics�]
